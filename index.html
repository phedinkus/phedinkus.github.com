<h3>Jill-Of-All-Trades</h3>
<div class='group'>
  <ul>
    <li>Endless curiosity about design aesthetics with a strong emphasis of how the design concept is deeply affected by the overall composition.</li>
    <li>Would not be chosen last for a team due to my big brain, loyalty and drive to work hard.</li>
    <li>Diverse background in design, technical detail work, construction, and customer service.</li>
    <li>When given a problem, I, like Vanilla Ice, will solve it. Although, with much better fashion sense. I'm a fast learner and analytical problem-solver with strong attention to detail.</li>
