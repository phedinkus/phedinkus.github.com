For the last 3+ years I've had lots of fun exploring Brandenburg, the state surrounding Berlin state. I take my gravel bike and my Westie on a train 1.5 to 2 hours out and roam around. This summer I tried out taking my bike to Slovenia and using trains to get around. It wasn't ideal and that wasn't even with the dog in tow. My conclusion was that using trains locally is perfect but beyond that I need more reliable transit. So I just bought a VW Caddy Maxi with plans to convert it to a camper van. I plan to build it out slowly and start by using it like a tent, with my camping stove and sleep system. 

I saw this video a couple months ago and I keep thinking about his ingenious ways of keeping his life in a trailer. It's an interesting watch.
