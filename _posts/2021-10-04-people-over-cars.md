A primary reason I moved to Germany is better transit planning. Granted so much of what we benefit from here came from over a century's worth of work and I believe we still have a ways to go to live in better harmony with the earth. Part of earth first thinking involves prioritizing people over cars. Better sidewalks, bigger, better bike lanes, better runoff management, etc. You can pretty much bet that if it sucks for a human to walk through, it sucks for nature. Here's a [podcast about depaving](https://overcast.fm/+BWmG_boAk) and a video about sidewalks that came on my radar to make me think more about our urban environment and the way it relates to people and nature.
