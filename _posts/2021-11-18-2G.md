I am now 2G. <em>geimpft.</em> <em>genesen.</em> German for vaccinated and recovered. Yeah, that's right, I got sick with a breakthrough infection of COVID. At no point did I get scary sick it still wasn't a good time. Essentially like a 2 week flu, which by itself is pretty hellish. The silver lining is I recovered in time for my first trip back to the USA in two years.
