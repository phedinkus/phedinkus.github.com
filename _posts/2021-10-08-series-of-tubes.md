My response when a non-tech person talks about how the internet works. Like when my mom felt dumb for not knowing the difference between a browser and a search engine. "It's just a series of tubes, mom." Which reminded me of [a great link I had seen of all the underwater fiber cables running around the world](https://globe.gl/example/submarine-cables/). 

This got me thinking, how big are these tubes? [Wikipedia says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_communications_cable#Cable_repair) modern cables are only 25 mm (1 in) in diameter. That just seems bonkers to me.
