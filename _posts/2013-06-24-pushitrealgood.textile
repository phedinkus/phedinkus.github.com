title: Fun with git post commit hooks

---

Almost immediately after I started programming I aliased 'git push origin master' to 'git pushitgood.' Tonight I finalized my masterpiece my making it a git post commit hook and having it play a snippet of Salt 'n Pepa's Push It Good.

bc=. afplay ~/.git/pushitrealgood.m4a
